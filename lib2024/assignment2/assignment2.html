			<p>The strike of a match. The light of a candle. Scent that slowly rises. Shuffling your favourite deck until the moment is right. The draw of the cards. Dropping the needle on your favorite LP. Sweet ritual.</p>
			<p>With a name inspired by the duality that lives within us all, we believe the small pause that lighting your candle brings is worth honouring; how a small action brings forth a steady, warm light. With fragrance blends as diverse as the folks who burn them, our candles were made for both quiet, sacred moments alone and cozy gatherings with the ones you love most.</p>
			<p>When Julie Klukas felt a spark of inspiration, she was compelled to fan its flames. We’ve all heard that cry at one time or another, and then it’s up to us to either follow or ignore it. But fire is in Julie’s blood…she worked as a firefighter in her community, and she knows its power. She’s adept at channeling it. She loves rock and roll and she loves pulling tarot, but most of all she loves her pack. Her community. Her world. And she knew it was time to do something for all of them, and for herself.</p>
			<p>Julie wanted to invite others to explore their own passions and memories. To light a fire, draw down the sacred and go within. But like the leader of a wolf pack, she knew that she had to go first…and that others would follow where she dared to walk. So she stuck out on her own and began the journey that led to Shy Wolf. She was joined by a fellow firefighter who quickly became her right-hand woman, and not long afterwards they were joined by the rest of our pack.</p>
			<p>Tucked away in the village of Grey Highlands, Ontario, our studio is surrounded by an empire of forest fed by the waters of the Saugeen. Moved by the raw beauty of our surroundings, we hand-pour each candle in the historic building we call home. They’re sustainably crafted with soy wax, cotton wicks, and a custom blend of natural scents inspired by classic rock and the tarot.</p>
			<p>We invite you to light your favourite candle and retreat into your favourite nook, like a wolf coming home to its den. And just like the wolves, you’ll know when it’s time to tend to your inner fire… and connect to the wilderness within.</p>
